    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Beze, also known as meringue, is a light and airy dessert made primarily
      from whipped egg whites and sugar. To prepare it, you start by beating egg
      whites until they form soft peaks, then gradually add sugar while
      continuing to whisk until stiff, glossy peaks develop. A pinch of salt or
      cream of tartar is often added to stabilize the mixture, and sometimes a
      touch of vanilla for flavor. The whipped mixture is then piped or spooned
      onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meringues are baked at a low temperature for an extended period,
      usually around 90–120°C (200–250°F), allowing them to dry out slowly
      without browning. This process creates a crisp outer shell with a light,
      chewy center. Beze can be enjoyed plain, dipped in chocolate, sandwiched
      with cream or jam, or used as a decorative element in cakes and pastries.
      This classic dessert is popular for its delicate sweetness and
      melt-in-your-mouth texture.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large egg whites (room temperature)</li>
      <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp cornstarch (optional, for extra stability)</li>
      <li>½ tsp cream of tartar or 1 tsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Equipment:
        <ul>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 100–120°C (200–250°F).</li>
          <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
          <li>
            Ensure your mixing bowl and beaters are completely clean and dry
            (any grease can prevent the egg whites from whipping).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Separate eggs carefully
        <ul>
          <li>
            Separate whites from yolks while the eggs are cold (easier to do).
          </li>
          <li>Make sure no yolk gets into the whites.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Start beating
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a stand mixer or with a hand mixer, beat the egg whites and a
            pinch of salt on medium speed until they become frothy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add stabilizer
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add cream of tartar or lemon juice and continue whisking until soft
            peaks form.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Incorporate sugar gradually
        <ul>
          <li>
            Increase speed to medium-high and add sugar one tablespoon at a
            time, allowing it to dissolve before adding more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue beating until you reach stiff, glossy peaks (when you lift
            the whisk, the peak stands upright and the mixture looks shiny).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flavoring
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gently fold in vanilla extract or other flavorings if desired.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe or spoon onto tray
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transfer mixture into a piping bag or spoon small mounds onto the
            prepared baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>Leave space between each meringue for airflow.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake low and slow
        <ul>
          <li>Bake at 90–110°C (200–230°F) for 1.5 to 2 hours.</li>
          <li>
            They should be dry to the touch and easily lift off parchment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool gradually
        <ul>
          <li>
            Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside with the door
            slightly open for about 30 minutes to prevent cracking from sudden
            temperature changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for success</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use superfine sugar if possible for quicker dissolving.</li>
      <li>Do not overbeat; stop once stiff peaks form.</li>
      <li>Humidity can ruin meringues – make them on a dry day if possible.</li>
    </ul>
